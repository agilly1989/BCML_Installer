This process will take a little while BUT it will install everything you need to run BCML (with a handy shortcut to get it running)

Notes...

* Visual C++ Build tools are pretty big .. 7GB+
* Visual C++ Runtimes will automatically install if you do not have them installed. If it asks you to repair/uninstall, just cancel the installer
* It is recommended to reboot your PC before installing Python (#2)
* This Python has been configured to install to this folder and will not be in your "ENV" .. I chose to do it this way so it does not interfere with any existing python installs
