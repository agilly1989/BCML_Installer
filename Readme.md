This process will take a little while BUT it will install everything you need to run BCML (with a handy shortcut to get it running)

Notes...

* Visual C++ Build tools are pretty big .. 7GB+
* Visual C++ Runtimes will automatically install if you do not have them installed. If it asks you to repair/uninstall, just cancel the installer
* It is recommended to reboot your PC before installing Python (#2)
* This Python has been configured to install to this folder and will not be in your "ENV" .. I chose to do it this way so it does not interfere with any existing python installs

# Install steps
Literally run each bach file (except the Uninstall/Delete ones) in order

# Lauching BCML
Literally double click on the "Launch BCML" one

# Uninstalling/Deleting it
Literally run the Uninstall/Delete batch files in order

# Updating BCML
I have no idea if BCML has a built-in updater *but* if it doesn't, you can run the "Install or Update BCML" file

# Things I need to do
* Add error checking
* Make it idiot proof
* Add more error checking
* Make a note to myself to add error checking
